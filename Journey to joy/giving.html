        <a>If you are a parent or guardian caring for a young person with mental health challenges, it can be challenging and have an impact on you. 
            Make time for self-care, lean on your support networks, and don't hesitate to reach out to professionals who can provide guidance and relief when you need it. You deserve to be supported, and it’s okay to ask for help for yourself as well.
