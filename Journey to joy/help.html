        <p>When someone you support tells you that they may have a mental health challenge, it’s an important step. Having that first conversation and deciding to seek help can make a big difference in helping them feel less alone and more supported.
<br>  <br>
            But what then? And how can you help?

        <section class="content" id="Getting informed">
            <h2>Getting informed
            </h2>
            <p>It’s not always immediately obvious when someone you care about is going through a tough time. But over time you may have a gut feeling that something isn’t right, and you may notice some changes....
         <br>   A good first step is to find information about what they are experiencing and what support is available. You may choose to do this together or by yourself, if they are happy with that. It's important to find sources you can trust. A good place to start is this website. Head to Health can help you find phone lines, online and digital resources, or health professionals.

            <br>You can encourage the person you are supporting to try the Head to Health quiz to find support services and resources. You can also offer to help them complete the quiz.
        </p></section>
        <section class="content" id="Supporting-someone">
            <h2>Supporting someone to see a health professional</h2>
            <p>If the person you care for agrees to it, you can go with them to appointments. Discuss beforehand how involved they would like you to be. For example, they might like you to attend the appointment with them, or they may ask you to wait in the waiting room, or not to come at all.
                <br>
                If you do attend, remember that the person you’re supporting is in the driver’s seat. They should do the talking, if possible.</p>
            <p>If you are present during an appointment, there are many supportive things you can do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Encourage them to be actively involved in their treatment and care.</li>
                
                <li> Ensure they have the final say on what gets shared.</li>
                
                <li> Observe, listen, and learn about how to support them outside of the session.</li>
                
                <li>Take notes and ask questions about anything you’re unsure about.
                </li>

       <h2> Providing support during treatment</h2>
        <p>An important part of caring for someone after they’ve received a diagnosis is supporting their treatment process. Different treatment plans will require different levels of support. 
</p>
<p>   You may need to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>encourage them to follow their prescription, keep up with any treatment, and keep appointments
<li>recognise that they will have ups and downs and their willingness to continue seeking help may go up and down </li>
 <li>monitor for side effects or unexpected behaviour changes when taking medication</li>

<li>support them between sessions, as they work through what has been discussed and put strategies in place. </li></li>
</ul>
