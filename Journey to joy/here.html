            <p>After receiving a diagnosis of a mental illness or mental disorder, it's normal to go through a range of emotions. You may feel scared, angry, sad, overwhelmed, or even ashamed. On the other hand, it can also be a relief, finally having a label to help describe how you've been feeling and thinking.</p>

            <p>Having a diagnosis can be one of the first steps towards working out your treatment options and starting to feel better. It can help you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Look into your condition</li>
                <li>Connect with other people who have experienced a similar thing</li>
                <li>Access certain services or funding for services through school, work, or private health insurance</li>
                <li>Find information on treatments and supports that can assist</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It can also help healthcare professionals develop and discuss a suitable treatment plan with you.</p>

                <p><strong>A diagnosis does not define you as a person</strong></p>
                <p>You don't need to use the diagnosis label or share it with other people if you don't want to. A diagnosis is just a way of describing the types of symptoms and experiences you have been having.</p>
