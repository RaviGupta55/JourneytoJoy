        <h1>“You are a better carer when you look after yourself, because who will look after the unwell person if you become unwell?”</h1>
        <p>You may be supporting a family member or friend just for right now, for a short period until they get back on their feet, or on a regular basis. Perhaps you spend a few hours every day helping them get to medical appointments, social outings, or shopping. Or maybe you are there to support them with all their activities all day on most days.
            <br>
            <br>

            Whatever the reasons or level of care you are providing, and whether or not you see yourself as a ’carer’, there is support available. There are services and resources you can access that can help making caring easier.
            <br>
            <br>

            While caring for someone can be rewarding, it can also be emotionally and physically challenging. If the person you are caring for has mental health challenges, they can go through mood and behaviour changes. Sometimes the person you are caring for may not want the care you are providing. Or they may not be able to do the things you think will benefit them.
            <br>            <br>

            You may feel frustrated, exhausted, lonely or isolated. You may feel that your needs are not as important as the needs of the person you are caring for. You may not even feel entitled to seek or get help. But looking after someone else is not a reason to forget or neglect to look after yourself. If you’re not looking after your own wellbeing, you likely won’t be able to support someone else.

       <h2> Providing support during treatment</h2>
        <p>An important part of caring for someone after they’ve received a diagnosis is supporting their treatment process. Different treatment plans will require different levels of support. 
</p>
<p>   You may need to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>encourage them to follow their prescription, keep up with any treatment, and keep appointments
<li>recognise that they will have ups and downs and their willingness to continue seeking help may go up and down </li>
 <li>monitor for side effects or unexpected behaviour changes when taking medication</li>

<li>support them between sessions, as they work through what has been discussed and put strategies in place. </li></li>
